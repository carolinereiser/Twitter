# Project 3 - *Twitter*

**Twitter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **18-20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- User sees app icon in home screen and styled launch screen
- User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- User can Logout
- User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- User can pull to refresh.
- User can tap the retweet and favorite buttons in a tweet cell to retweet and/or favorite a tweet.
- User can compose a new tweet by tapping on a compose button.
- Using AutoLayout, the Tweet cell should adjust its layout for iPhone 11, Pro and SE device sizes as well as accommodate device rotation.
- User should display the relative timestamp for each tweet "8m", "7h"
- Tweet Details Page: User can tap on a tweet to view it, with controls to retweet, favorite, and reply.

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- User can view their profile in a *profile tab*
  - Contains the user header view: picture and tagline
  - Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
  - Profile view should include that user's timeline
- User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count. Refer to [[this guide|unretweeting]] for help on implementing unretweeting.
- User can tap the profile image in any tweet to see another user's profile
  - Contains the user header view: picture and tagline
  - Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- When composing, you should have a countdown for the number of characters remaining for the tweet (out of 280) (**1 point**)
- After creating a new tweet, a user should be able to view it in the timeline immediately without refetching the timeline from the network.
- User can reply to any tweet, and replies should be prefixed with the username and the reply_id should be set when posting the tweet (**2 points**)
- User can switch between timeline, mentions, or profile view through a tab bar (**3 points**)


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- Customized UI
- Tweet count/like count/favorite count etc. formatted when over 10,000 (e.g. 18333 = 18.3K)


Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Clickable links
2. How to do the pull down to blur image

## Notes

I really wanted to implement clickable links but every library I tried was deprecated.
